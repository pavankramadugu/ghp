Hey there! I'm Pavan. I did my bachelors at the Indian Institute of Information Technology, Allahabad and, I am currently working as a Software Engineer at Deutsche Bank.

My areas of interest include data-intensive application development, distributed systems, and machine intelligence.

I watch a lot of cinema and am a big sports fan. Real Madrid and Ferrari are my favourite teams.
